[question]
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

[question]
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-If it was Automatic, it would be really annoying to have my computer constantly downloading stuffs
