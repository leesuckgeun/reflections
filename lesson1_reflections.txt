[question]
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
-pro: assuming you commit idealy, you can have a clear history of code
-con: human dependent. 

[question]
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
-git allows that because coding is about making connection between codes. I dont know why google doc doesnt allow that

[question]
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
-type git log to view the list of the commits, and use git diff to find any differences of two commits

[question]
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
